# matjectNEXT

## As of [Nov 26, 2024](https://github.com/faizul726/matject/commit/75b10ae4fff4acd90badd81a5c3456d9c28fa751), matjectNEXT is fully integrated into [Matject](https://github.com/faizul726/matject/), and this repository is now outdated and abandoned.
***Thank you all for the support.***

### v0.3.1 is somewhat stable now.

```
User experience may not be that good.
```

### ~~This will be merged into [Matject](https://github.com/faizul726/matject) soon~~.
I don't know why it doesn't work properly for others. So, not merging.  
Since it's working, I will leave it as-is.

> **Current state: Core features work fine without any issue so far, unoptimized but can be optimized further later.**
> 
> **Missing features: Unlock WindowsApps, Minecraft version detection.**
