### v0.3.1 is somewhat stable now.

```
User experience may not be that good.

### This will be merged into [Matject](https://github.com/faizul726/matject) soon.

> **Current state: Core features work fine without any issue so far, unoptimized but can be optimized further later.**
> 
> **Missing features: Unlock WindowsApps, Minecraft version detection.**
