echo Matject was initially created as an alternative to BetterRenderDragon by @ddf8196. Later, I decided to continue working on it since the devs of BRD were unable to update BRD in a while.
echo.
echo Seeing the success, I created matjectNEXT as the successor of Matject. It features (almost) automated dynamic replacement of materials by looking at global_resource_packs.json for changes.
echo.
echo.
echo I am really grateful to all users of my creation. It inspires me to make Matject better for everyone.
